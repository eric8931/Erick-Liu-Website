			  <h3>Basketball</h3>
			  <p>I have always loved playing basketball since I was a kid. I always head over to Ramshead Gym once my classes are done. This is how I have met most of my friends in college, just playing basketball together at the gym.</p>

			  <h3>Cooking</h3>
			  <p>Since my parents owned a restaurant, I have always loved to cook new dishes. Some of my favorite dishes to cook(and eat!) are fried rice with chicken and shrimp, steaks, and chicken katsu. </p>

			  <h3>Working Out</h3>
			  <p>I started working out around the start of my first year in college. I always had a little fat on me and I wanted to get leaner as well as more muscular. The gym is my favorite place to be since I can just listen to music and focus on something simple, which is moving weights.</p>

			  <h3>10 Books</h3>
			  <p>If I was on a deserted island, the books that I would choose would be one of my favorite childhood book series, which would be the Harry Potter series. Since this would already take up seven books, the last 3 would probably have to be on survival, since I would need to figure out how to find food and water, as well as building shelters.</p>
